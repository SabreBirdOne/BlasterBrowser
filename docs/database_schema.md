# OVERVIEW
This file serves as documentation on the design of the database. It includes a natural description of the data. Due to the project using PostgreSQL, which is a relational database,
this file contains an Entity-Relationship Diagram and an abstract relational schema, which serves as a starting point in implementing the database.

**Warming up**
Here's a link to a Google Drive document: "A Convenient List for New Nerfers With Too Much Money for Their Own Good", a Hobby Blaster Catalogue.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Hw1tJ7mDTvTfsuYxSW-Jt3kofQ2ssyZX8zoZuN_os8/edit#heading=h.s3sb7j7jz7q6

The document is found in the r/Nerf subreddit. Link:

The document categorizes blasters based on the author's own criteria, such as "Injection molded" or "Springer Carbines". 
And "the terminology used is an analogue in order to represent certain attributes of the blaster". For the sake of the database schema, I think we may need another way to categorize blaster.
