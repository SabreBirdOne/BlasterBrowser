# BlasterBrowser

**PROJECT SUMMARY**

This is the BlasterBrowser repository and project. The project's goals are to create and maintain a browser of hobby-grade foam blasters. It includes a database system to store data, and a user-friendly interface for the end user. 

**PROJECT MOTIVATION**

In the 2020s, we (the contributors of the project) have seen the rise of hobby-grade blasters being distributed and sold at increasingly larger scales and availability, and thus the number of options substantially increase. Thus, we want hobbyists to have a better grasp on the overall market in terms of what is being offered, to fit their budgets and tastes in foam blasting.

**HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE**

Honestly, I (SabreBirdOne) don't know how to handle this too well. 

For end users, you can open a GitHub issue, or contact me via Reddit (u/SabreBirdOne) or GitHub.
For programmers, I think you can send pull requests and we can review the code changes together?

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

If there are any bugs or issues encountered, you can open a GitHub issue or contact a contributor, and hopefully we can respond.
